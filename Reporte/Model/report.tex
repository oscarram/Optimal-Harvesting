%Exponential Growth
Before focusing on the harvesting problem, we focus on modelling a  ``pure" population growth, without introducing an artificial harvesting control. We can model the population growth problem, as one dynamical system in which $x$ represents the fish population, and the population variation with respect to time $\dot{x}$ can be  described as a function of the fish population and/or time:

\begin{equation}
\dev{x}{t}=F(x,t)
\end{equation}
