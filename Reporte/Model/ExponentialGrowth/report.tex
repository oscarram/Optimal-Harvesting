%Exponential Growth

Assuming the natural fish mortality to be a constant $M$, we get the growth dynamics as,
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lll}
\dev{x}{t}&=&-mx\\
x(T)&=&x_T
\end{array}
\end{equation}

If a variable mortality due to fishing $\Phi(t)$, is also considered then the growth equation becomes,


\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{lll}
		\dev{x}{t}&=&-(m+\Phi(t))x\\
		x(T)&=&x_T\\
	\end{array}
\end{equation}
