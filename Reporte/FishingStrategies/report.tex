Generally, there are three methods to model aquaculture mathematically:

\begin{itemize}
\item Open Loop harvesting Strategies: One of the simplest methods to implement, harvesting a number of fishes without regarding the state of the population.

\item Closed Loop harvesting Strategies: A more complex strategy to implement, with the advantage that it is possible to introduce a control over the population in order to avoid extinction.
\end{itemize}
