Given a time horizon $T$ we want to extract the maximum amount of fishes, during this time.
\begin{equation}
H=\int_{0}^{T} u(t)\diff{t}
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
	\dev{x}{t}=rx\left(1-\frac{x}{M}\right)-u(t)
\end{equation}
From the above result we see that for $u(t)>\frac{rM}{4}$, we lead the population to extinction.
