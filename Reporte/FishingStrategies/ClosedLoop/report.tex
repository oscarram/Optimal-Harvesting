Closed loop strategies implement feedback as part of the dynamic, in order to improve the dynamic of the system. We write mathematically, the resulting dynamic of implementing a closed loop strategy as follows,
\begin{equation}
\dev{x}{t}=\Psi(x,t)+C(x,t)
\end{equation}
where $\Psi(x,t)$ is the intrinsic dynamic of the system, and $C(x,t)$ is the implemented control, which is a function of the population an time.
