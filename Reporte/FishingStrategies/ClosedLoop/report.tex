Closed loop strategies implement feedback as part of the dynamic, in order to improve the dynamic of the system. In this section, two different closed loop fish harvesting strategies have been developed, and all incorporate a population dependent harvesting type.
\begin{equation}
\dev{x}{t}=\Psi(x,t)+C(x,t)
\end{equation}
where $\Psi(x,t)$ is the intrinsic dynamic of the system, and $C(x,t)$ is the implemented control, which is population dependent.
