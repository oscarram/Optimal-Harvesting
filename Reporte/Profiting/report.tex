In the previous discussion, we have focused on optimizing the amount of harvested fish. A more useful aim, is to optimize the economical profits obtained from selling the fish. For this section consider the harvest strategy $u(t)=p(t)x(t)|$, subject to,
\begin{equation}
  u(t)=p(t)x(t)=rx(t)\left(1-\frac{x(t)}{M}\right)-\dev{x}{t}
\end{equation}
