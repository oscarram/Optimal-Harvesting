\begin{enumerate}
\item Analysis of functions skewed logistic functions. That is $\alpha$, $\beta$ greater than one, such that 
\begin{equation}
	\dev{x}{t}=rx^\alpha\left(1-\frac{x}{M}\right)^\beta
\end{equation}

\item Fast-time varying parameters $r$, $M$. For quasi-stationary seasonal change parameters we can apply the same results, considering seasonal harvesting.

\item Economical analysis for non-linear costs.
